Environment: An environment is an organization tool to provide segregation of testing vs. production workflows. API Keys are locked down by environment. 

Wallet: A wallet is where your funds and credit balances are managed in a UI format. There are two wallet types. Development and Mainnet. 

If you went through Voltage sales, you may already have an environment set up for you. If so, you may proceed directly to the Developer Guide.  If you are going through the self serve flow, the following guide will walk you through initial setup to generate your first wallet for development and testing.
