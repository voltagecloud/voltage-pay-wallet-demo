With our easy to use APIs, you can quickly and easily integrate Lightning payments into your products and services. Not only is Voltage Payments the best way to move Bitcoin and Stablecoins, you'll also be able instantly convert your transactions into USD*. Let’s break down how this works.

The Voltage Payments platform is an all-in-one solution via an easy to use API. There are no nodes, channels, or liquidity to worry about, Voltage handles it all. Customers can use either our API or our dashboard to view transactions, send & receive payments, manage wallets, and more.

When sending and receiving payments, you will be able to use any of our supported assets. Currently the only supported asset is Bitcoin, however we plan to add USDT soon. 

The platform has built-in support for team management. You can add users and set permissions easily via our dashboard. Additionally, you can create API keys that are environment specific to easily segregate permissions based on your application deployments.

To summarize:

    Payments boasts a simple and straightforward API.
    There's no nodes, channels, or liquidity to worry about. Voltage handles all of it.
    Transact with a variety of assets of the Lightning Network.
    Robust dashboard to manage your team, wallets, and transactions.
    Team management to easily collaborate across your entire company.

The Voltage Payments platform functions very similar to a business credit card. Once approved, an organization is given a Line of Credit. At the end of the billing cycle, customers are simply charged for their usage through the cycle. This comes with significant advantages over alternative schemes. 

This means that you can start sending payments without needing to first fund your wallet. Additionally, this drastically simplifies the ongoing capital requirements for sending payments. There's no more unnecessary capital lockups. You only pay for what you send after you've sent it. Not only is it most capital efficient, it also means less exposure to third-parties for your funds.

This Line of Credit is the maximum amount of sends you can do in a given billing cycle. Any payments received during the billing cycle are directly applied to this Line of Credit. Billing cycle durations can be a duration of weekly, biweekly, monthly. At the end of the billing cycle, Voltage will calculate an invoice that includes any outstanding credit balances (sent payments that need to be paid back) plus platform fees.

The billing cycle invoices can be paid with either Bitcoin or US Dollars*. The currency configuration of the Line of Credit is set at onboarding and can't be changed. When the currency is set to USD, Voltage will automatically deduct invoice payments from the customers bank account via ACH. This means that a customer could integrate Bitcoin or Stablecoin payments into their application without ever having exposure to the assets themselves.

*USD Invoice payments are coming soon, only Bitcoin is supported today.

To summarize:

    Voltage Payments functions like a credit card, giving customers a line of credit for sending payments
    The credit structure gives significant benefits for capital controls and efficiency.
    At the end of a billing cycle, Voltage invoices customers for sent payments.
    Customers can pay their invoices in BTC or USD.
    USD invoice payments allow customers to get benefits of Lightning without asset exposure.
